# AssignmentMod4
Linux course final assignment
Brief: 
Imagine that you are a lead Linux developer at the top-tech company ABC International Inc. ABC currently suffers from a huge bottleneck: each day, interns must painstakingly access encrypted password files on core servers and back up any files that were updated within the last 24 hours. This process introduces human error, lowers security, and takes an unreasonable amount of work.

As one of ABC Inc.'s most trusted Linux developers, you have been tasked with creating a script called backup.sh which runs every day and automatically backs up any encrypted password files that have been updated in the past 24 hours.

There are a total of 20 points to be earned for 17 tasks in this final project.
Your grade will be based on the following tasks within the hands-on lab:

[Tasks 1-13]: Upload screenshot of sections from the backup.sh script displaying the correct code (13 pts: 1 pt for each of the 13 tasks)
[Task 14]: Submit your completed backup.sh file (1 pt)
[Task 15]: Upload screenshot showing executable permissions (2 pts)
[Task 16]: Upload screenshot showing file named backup-[TIMESTAMP].tar.gz (2 pts)
[Task 17]: Upload screenshot showing crontab schedule of once every day (2 pts)
